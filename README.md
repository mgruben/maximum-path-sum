# maximum-path-sum 
A way of finding the largest adjacent-path sum in a triangle of numbers

This project was completed for the [Project Euler - Problem 67](https://projecteuler.net/problem=67).

I recommend that this code should only be viewed _after_ you've completed your own implementation.  
If you're super stuck, take a break, take a walk, and it will come to you; good luck.
